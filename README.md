## Architecture

- **Storage**: IndexedDB via Dexie with `CatalogueStorageProvider` interface
- **Caching**: Memory → localStorage → IndexedDB → Static JSON → OpenAlex API
- **Routing**: Entity-centric (`/authors/A123`, `/works/W123`, `/doi/...`)
- **State**: TanStack React Query + Dexie stores

## OpenAlex API

Entity prefixes: **W** Works, **A** Authors, **S** Sources, **I** Institutions, **P** Publishers, **F** Funders, **T** Topics, **C** Concepts, **K** Keywords, **D** Domains, **SF** Subfields

URL patterns: `/authors/A123`, `/works/W123`, `/doi/10.1038/...`, `/$bareId` (auto-detect)

## Development Guidelines

See [Project Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md) for development principles.

## Testing

Run with `pnpm test` or `pnpm validate` for full pipeline.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions: validate → e2e → deploy → post-deploy verification → semantic-release. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

- Acceptance:
  - Multi-select checkboxes for each entity type
  - Filtering updates results without full page reload
  - Filter state reflected in URL for shareability
  - Result count per type displayed before filtering

**US-05: External identifier lookup**
As a researcher, I want to look up entities by external identifiers (DOI, ORCID, ISSN, ROR) so I can jump directly to a known entity without searching.
- Acceptance:
