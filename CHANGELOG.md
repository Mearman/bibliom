### BREAKING CHANGE

* ESLint now strictly forbids all unused variables without exceptions
* None (infrastructure only, no API changes)
* Removed multiple tsconfig variants in favor of unified configs

Root level changes:
- Add vite.config.lib.ts for shared library build configuration
- Remove obsolete tsconfig files: library, react, typecheck, vitest, app
- Update tsconfig.base.json with wildcard path mappings for subpath imports
- Fix broken project references in tsconfig.json
- Pin @types/node to 24.10.0 to resolve Vite type conflicts
- Update nx.json to rename Vite typecheck target avoiding conflicts

Package changes (algorithms, client, types, utils, ui):
- Simplify tsconfig.json to typecheck-only config (noEmit, no composite)
- Remove redundant tsconfig.spec.json, tsconfig.typecheck.json files
- Add vite.config.ts using shared createLibConfig for Vite builds
- Update project.json to use @nx/vite:build executor
- Update vitest.config.ts to reference simplified tsconfig

Apps/web changes:
- Remove tsconfig.app.json (merged into tsconfig.json)
- Update tsconfig.json to extend tsconfig.base.json directly
- Add React-specific options (jsx, DOM libs) inline

This consolidation reduces config files from 8 root tsconfigs to 3,
and removes per-package tsconfig variants while maintaining the same
typecheck and build behavior.

### BREAKING CHANGE

* CI workflow restructured with independent test jobs

- Created separate jobs for each test type:
  - unit-tests: Runs *.unit.test.{ts,tsx} files
  - integration-tests: Runs *.integration.test.{ts,tsx} files
  - component-tests: Runs *.component.test.{ts,tsx} files
  - e2e: Runs *.e2e.test.ts files (Playwright)

- Split quality-gates into focused jobs:
  - security-audit: Runs pnpm audit for vulnerabilities
  - dependency-audit: Runs pnpm deps:check for health

- All test jobs:
  - Download build artifacts from build job (no rebuilds)
  - Download Nx cache from build job (shared caching)
  - Run in parallel after build completes
  - Upload separate coverage artifacts

- Benefits:
  - No duplicate tasks across jobs (each task runs once)
  - Faster feedback (tests run in parallel)
  - Shared Nx cache reduces redundant work
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Better visibility into which test type fails

- Updated job dependencies:
  - deploy: Requires all tests + audits to pass
  - release: Requires all tests + audits + deploy to pass
  - results: Shows status of all individual jobs
* Test jobs now run as matrix (8 packages × 3 test types)

- Replaced separate test jobs with matrix-based tests job:
  - Removed: unit-tests, integration-tests, component-tests
  - Added: tests (matrix job)

- Matrix dimensions:
  - packages: [web, cli, client, graph, simulation, types, ui, utils]
  - test-types: [unit, integration, component]
  - Total combinations: 24 parallel jobs

- Benefits:
  - Better parallelization (24 vs 3 jobs)
  - Faster feedback (individual package failures visible immediately)
  - Better resource utilization (matrix jobs can run concurrently)
  - Clear per-package test status in GitHub UI
  - Separate coverage artifacts per package/test-type

- Matrix job features:
  - Dynamic package path detection (apps/ vs packages/)
  - Graceful handling of missing tests (exits 0 if no tests found)
  - Per-matrix coverage uploads (coverage-{package}-{test-type})
  - fail-fast: false (continue testing other combinations on failure)

- Updated job dependencies:
  - deploy: Now depends on tests (matrix) instead of 3 separate jobs
  - release: Now depends on tests (matrix) instead of 3 separate jobs
  - results: Shows "Tests (Matrix)" with count of parallel jobs
* userEmail is now string | undefined

- Add apiKey parameter to OpenAlexClientConfig
- Add apiKey to FullyConfiguredClient interface (string | undefined)
- Update buildUrl() to include api_key query parameter when provided
- Add updateOpenAlexApiKey() function for runtime configuration
- Export updateOpenAlexApiKey from client package
- Make userEmail optional (string | undefined) throughout client
- Default both userEmail and apiKey to undefined

### Breaking change

* for spec-018: removes re-export tasks from entity
consolidation plan. All backward compatibility re-exports violate new
principle and must be eliminated.

Refs: constitution v2.4.0 (MINOR bump - new principle added)

### BREAKING CHANGE

* All EntityType imports now use @bibgraph/types

Centralize EntityType definition to packages/types/src/entities/entities.ts
as the single source of truth. All packages and apps now import EntityType
from @bibgraph/types instead of local duplicates.

Changes:
- Remove EntityType from graph/src/types/core.ts (imported from types pkg)
- Remove EntityType from utils/storage/catalogue-db.ts (imported from types pkg)
- Remove EntityType re-exports from graph and utils package indices
- Add EntityType import to utils/url-compression.ts (full 12-type support)
- Fix graph package: 25 files updated to import from types package
- Fix web app: 35 files updated to import from types package
  - Remove local singular EntityType definitions
  - Convert all entity type references from singular to plural forms
  - Update ENTITY_TYPE_CONFIGS keys: author→authors, work→works, etc.
  - Fix AddToListModal to use canonical EntityType (remove mapping)
  - Add missing entity types (concepts, keywords) to catalogue counts
- Fix CLI: Already using correct imports (no changes needed)

Constitution Compliance:
- Removed all EntityType re-exports (Principle III: no re-exports)
- All imports now direct from canonical source

Coverage:
✅ All 12 OpenAlex entity types supported:
   works, authors, sources, institutions, topics, concepts,
   publishers, funders, keywords, domains, fields, subfields

Files modified: 71
- Graph package: 26 files
- Utils package: 9 files
- Web app: 35 files
- CLI: 1 file (verified correct)

Build status: All packages build successfully
- types ✅
- utils ✅
- graph ✅
- client ✅
- simulation ✅
- ui ✅
- cli ✅
- web ✅
* CachedEntityMetadata.type changed from EntityType to
CacheStorageType (internal change, affects cache browser only)
* Constitution version 2.1.0 → 2.2.0 (MINOR)

New workflow requirement:
- ALWAYS commit changes to ./specs/ directory after each phase completion
- Spec commits MUST use docs(spec-###): prefix
- Commit spec changes separately from implementation changes

Example spec commit:
  git add specs/018-entity-consolidation/
  git commit -m "docs(spec-018): complete Phase 1 setup tasks"

Refs: .specify/memory/constitution.md (Principle VI)
Refs: .specify/templates/plan-template.md (Constitution Check)
Refs: .specify/templates/spec-template.md (Constitution Alignment)
* Constitution version 2.2.0 → 2.3.0 (MINOR)

Follow-up TODOs:
- Implement automatic command chaining in /speckit.plan workflow logic
- Update command templates to check for blockers before auto-progressing

Refs: constitution v2.3.0 Principle X
* Consumers importing EntityType from @bibgraph/graph
must update imports to @bibgraph/types
* Entity metadata helper functions moved from graph package
to types package. Import from @bibgraph/types instead of
@bibgraph/graph/taxonomy/entity-taxa.
* EntityType union now includes domains, fields, subfields

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **deps:** Upgrade vitest from 3.2.4 to 4.0.10 (major version bump)

- Upgrade vitest from ^3.2.4 to ^4.0.10
- Upgrade @vitest/coverage-v8 from ^3.2.4 to ^4.0.10
- Upgrade @vitest/ui from ^3.2.4 to ^4.0.10
- Add pnpm override for glob>=10.5.0 to fix CVE (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)

The vitest v4 upgrade removes the vulnerable glob@10.4.5 transitive dependency
that was present in @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4 via test-exclude. The new version
(4.0.10) no longer depends on test-exclude, eliminating the vulnerability entirely.

Additionally, added a pnpm override to ensure all glob dependencies are >=10.5.0,
which patches the command injection vulnerability in glob CLI (affects versions
10.2.0-10.5.0).

Security fix for:
- Package: glob
- Vulnerable versions: >=10.2.0 <10.5.0
- Patched versions: >=10.5.0
- CVE: GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2 (high severity)

Peer dependency warnings:
- @nx/vite expects vitest ^1.3.1 || ^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0 (now using 4.0.10)
  This is expected and does not affect functionality as Nx uses vitest
  programmatically without relying on breaking API changes.

Packages updated: +36 -125 (net: -89 packages)
* **graph:** Adds TOPIC_PART_OF_FIELD and FIELD_PART_OF_DOMAIN edge types

## Implementation

**Topic Hierarchy (T043-T046)**:
- Extract field, domain, subfield from topic data
- Create edges: topic → field, field → domain, topic → subfield
- Direction: 'outbound'
- Stub nodes: field and domain entities for taxonomy visualization

**ID Handling (T049)**:
- Helper extractFieldOrDomainId() parses field/domain URLs
- Format: https://openalex.org/fields/17 → fields/17
- Validation with warnings (expected for taxonomy IDs)

## Tests

- T039: Unit test for Topic → Field edges ✅
- T040: Unit test for Field → Domain edges ✅
- T041: Integration test for complete taxonomy path ✅
- T042: Unit test for reverse topic lookup ✅

All topic tests passing. No regressions in authorship/citation/funding tests.

## Files Changed

- packages/graph/src/providers/topics.test.ts (new, 223 lines)
- packages/graph/src/providers/openalex-provider.ts (enhanced expandTopicWithCache)
- Type fixes in entity-resolver-interface.ts, base-provider.ts

## Functional Requirements

Implements FR-013, FR-014, FR-015, FR-016, FR-027, FR-030, FR-031

## Checkpoint

User Stories 1-4 complete - authorship, citations, funding, topics functional
* **graph:** Adds FUNDED_BY edge type for funding networks

## Implementation

**Forward Funding (T032-T034)**:
- Extract grants[] from work data
- Create edges: work → funder
- Direction: 'outbound'
- Metadata: award_id from grant object
- Configurable limit (default: 5 grants)

**Reverse Funding (T035-T036)**:
- Query OpenAlex API: works({ filter: { "grants.funder": funderId } })
- Create edges: work → funder
- Direction: 'inbound' (discovered via reverse lookup)
- Maintains semantic direction even for reverse-discovered edges

**Utilities (T037-T038)**:
- Uses extractOpenAlexId() for URL and bare ID formats
- ID validation using validateOpenAlexId()
- Graceful handling of missing/invalid grants

## Tests

- T028: Unit test for Work → Funder funding edges ✅
- T029: Unit test for grant metadata (award_id) ✅
- T030: Unit test for missing funding handling ✅
- T031: Unit test for funder reverse lookup ✅

All 11 funding tests passing. All authorship/citation tests passing (no regressions).

## Data Model

Edge Direction Semantics:
- Semantic: ALWAYS work → funder (source → target)
- Discovery: 'outbound' (from grants[]) or 'inbound' (reverse lookup)
- Canonical ID: createCanonicalEdgeId(workId, funderId, RelationType.FUNDED_BY)

## Files Changed

- packages/graph/src/providers/funding.test.ts (new, 693 lines)
- packages/graph/src/providers/openalex-provider.ts (+95 lines)
  - Added funding edge creation in expandWorkWithCache()
  - Added new expandFunderWithCache() method
  - Added funder case to entity expansion switch

## Functional Requirements

Implements FR-009, FR-010, FR-011, FR-012, FR-025, FR-026, FR-030, FR-031

## Checkpoint

User Stories 1, 2, AND 3 complete - authorship, citations, and funding networks functional
* **graph:** Adds REFERENCE edge type for citation networks

## Implementation

**Forward Citations (T022-T024)**:
- Extract referenced_works[] from work data
- Create edges: citing work → cited work
- Direction: 'outbound'
- Metadata: citation_count from cited_by_count field
- Configurable limit (default: 20 references)

**Reverse Citations (T025)**:
- Query OpenAlex API: works({ filter: { cites: workId } })
- Create edges: citing work → cited work
- Direction: 'inbound' (discovered via reverse lookup)
- Maintains semantic direction even for reverse-discovered edges

**Utilities (T027)**:
- Added extractOpenAlexId() to handle URL and bare ID formats
- ID validation using validateOpenAlexId()
- Graceful handling of missing/invalid references

## Tests

- T018: Unit test for Work → Work citation edges ✅
- T019: Unit test for citation metadata extraction ✅
- T020: Integration test for citation chains (W1→W2→W3) ✅
- T021: Unit test for reverse citation lookup ✅

All 7 citation tests passing. All 8 authorship tests passing (no regressions).

## Data Model

Edge Direction Semantics:
- Semantic: ALWAYS citing work → cited work (source → target)
- Discovery: 'outbound' (from referenced_works[]) or 'inbound' (reverse lookup)
- Canonical ID: createCanonicalEdgeId(citingWorkId, citedWorkId, RelationType.REFERENCE)

## Files Changed

- packages/graph/src/providers/citations.test.ts (new, 473 lines)
- packages/graph/src/providers/openalex-provider.ts (+89 lines)
- packages/graph/src/utils/edge-utils.ts (+30 lines)
- packages/graph/src/taxonomy/entity-taxa.ts (added 3 RelationType entries)

## Functional Requirements

Implements FR-005, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008, FR-031, FR-032

## Checkpoint

User Stories 1 AND 2 complete - authorship and citation networks functional
* **graph:** AUTHORSHIP edge direction reversed to match OpenAlex data model

**Critical Bug Fixed**:
Previously created edges with Author as source and Work as target (Author → Work).
Now correctly creates edges with Work as source and Author as target (Work → Author).

**User Story 1 (P1 - MVP)**: View Authorship Relationships Correctly ✅
- FR-001: Reverse AUTHORSHIP edge direction (Work → Author)
- FR-002: Set direction='outbound' for work expansion
- FR-003: Set direction='inbound' for author expansion
- FR-004: Use canonical edge IDs to prevent duplicates

**Implementation** (Tasks T001-T017 - 17/90):

Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
- Added missing RelationType enum values
- Created createCanonicalEdgeId() utility
- Created validateOpenAlexId() utility
- Created ExpansionLimits interface
- Created edge metadata type interfaces

Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T009)
- Implemented edge deduplication logic
- Implemented batch entity preloading
- Implemented getRelationshipLimit() helper
- Added truncation metadata to GraphExpansion

Phase 3: US1 - AUTHORSHIP Fix (T010-T017)
- Tests: 8 comprehensive tests (all passing)
- Implementation: Fixed edge directions, canonical IDs, validation

**Test Results**:
✅ All 8 authorship tests passing
✅ openalex-provider.unit.test.ts: 62/62 passing
✅ basic-provider-usage.integration.test.ts: 12/12 passing

Spec: specs/015-openalex-relationships/
* **graph,web:** Updated RelationType enum usage across graph and web packages
to align with spec 014 implementation (phases 1-3).

  - AUTHORED → AUTHORSHIP (3 occurrences)
  - PUBLISHED_IN → PUBLICATION (2 occurrences)
  - AFFILIATED → AFFILIATION (1 occurrence)
  - WORK_HAS_TOPIC → TOPIC (1 occurrence)

  - Removed deprecated alias entries
- expansion-settings.ts: Updated DEFAULT_EXPANSION_SETTINGS
  - REFERENCES → REFERENCE

- intra-node-edge-population.integration.test.ts: Same migrations

Deployment Readiness Progress:
- ✅ Graph package typecheck: 0 errors (was 38 errors)
- ✅ Web package typecheck: 0 errors
- ⚠️  Web tests: 14 failures remaining (down from 18, 78% passing)

Per Constitution Principle IX (Deployment Readiness), working towards
zero outstanding issues. Remaining test failures require investigation.
* **root:** Constitution v1.5.0 → v2.0.0

Added Principle IX: Deployment Readiness (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Work is NOT complete if there are ANY outstanding issues in the repository,
including pre-existing issues. Deployment cannot run if ANY package has
typecheck errors, test failures, lint violations, or build failures.

Key requirements:
- ALL packages MUST pass typecheck, test, lint, build
- Pre-existing issues MUST be fixed or explicitly deferred
- Commits with --no-verify MUST be followed by immediate fixes
- Features cannot be marked complete if deployment would fail

Modified Principle VII: Development-Stage Pragmatism
- Clarified that deployment readiness still applies during development
- Breaking changes are acceptable; broken builds are not

Updated Development Workflow:
- Added deployment readiness verification step
- Quality pipeline now explicitly covers ALL packages

Updated Quality Gates:
- Added deployment readiness gates section
- pnpm validate MUST pass before marking work complete
- CI/CD pipeline MUST be able to deploy without intervention

Rationale:
The project uses GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD. If ANY package has
errors, the entire deployment fails. This creates critical dependency
issues where completed features cannot be deployed due to unrelated
pre-existing errors.

This principle ensures:
- Every feature can be deployed immediately upon completion
- No feature leaves deployment blockers for future work
- Main branch always remains in deployable state
- Pre-existing issues are surfaced and resolved, not ignored
- Research demonstrations can be scheduled confidently

Templates requiring updates:
- plan-template.md (Constitution Check → 9 principles)
- spec-template.md (Constitution Alignment → 9 principles)
- tasks-template.md (Constitution compliance → 9 principles)

Addresses user requirement that work completion requires zero outstanding
issues across the entire repository to enable successful deployment.
* **docs:** Constitution now requires test-first approach for all bug fixes
* **graph:** Type errors expected in consuming code. Phase 3 will update
all services to use new enum names and add direction field to edges.

Tests: packages/graph/src/types/core.test.ts (7/7 passed)
Spec: specs/014-edge-direction-correction
Phase: 2 (Foundational - Type Definitions)
Tasks: T004-T010 complete

## 8.43.4 (2025-09-30)

### 🩹 Fixes

- **versions:** restore independent package versioning from correct baseline

  All package versions have been corrected to reflect their true change history from monorepo creation. Each package (except web) started at 1.0.0 when extracted from the main app, while web inherited its pre-monorepo version of 8.1.0.

  **Corrected Package Versions:**
  - `@bibgraph/web`: 8.43.4 (from 8.1.0 baseline)
  - `@bibgraph/cli`: 1.3.0 (from 1.0.0 baseline)
  - `@bibgraph/client`: 1.28.0 (from 1.0.0 baseline)
  - `@bibgraph/graph`: 1.14.0 (from 1.0.0 baseline)
  - `@bibgraph/utils`: 2.1.3 (from 1.0.0 baseline, includes breaking change)
  - `@bibgraph/simulation`: 1.0.4 (from 1.0.0 baseline)
  - `@bibgraph/ui`: 1.3.0 (from 1.0.0 baseline)

  All package changelogs have been rewritten to accurately reflect their independent version history with proper semantic versioning based on conventional commits.
